# About me 👨‍💻
I've been studying software development, new technologies and their ways of application for over 2 years. 💻
In essence, I haven’t been focusing on development for too long, but I believe that one day I'll be able to make life a little more convenient, not just for myself. I love video games and tennis. 🛠️
Happy to see you here🕺
